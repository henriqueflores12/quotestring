# quotestring

using quotes inside of string...
sometimes you will want to use a doble or single quotes mark within a string.
because strings can live in single or doble quotes,if you just want to use doble quotes in the string,you could surraound the entire string in single quotes.
you can also use a technique called scaping the quotation characters.
this is done by using "backwards slash"(or "backslash")before anytype of quote
mark that appers within a string (as shown on the fourth line of the code).
the backwards slash tells the interpreter that the following characters is part of the string
rather than the end of it...
